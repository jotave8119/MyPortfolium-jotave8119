                About: "My name is Jo√£o Vitor Teixeira da Silva, I'm 26 years old, I'm from Rio de Janeiro(Brazil) and I'm a Front end developer. I have been studying web development for a little over 9 months and I have a Front end development certificate from Kenzie Academy Brasil. There I was part of several individual and team projects. It was very rewarding. Today I'm in the first semester of Systems Analysis and Development at UNOPAR. Despite being in the area for a short time, a few years ago the technology area gradually attracted me. The world of development gives me a sense of belonging and being part of something really big and innovative. The challenges are constant, but I fall in love with this world more and more. I'm looking for my first opportunity in the job market as a junior developer or intern. My goal is to establish myself more and more in the area with a lot of effort and dedication. I'm a prostitute (always wanted to make that joke) üë®üèª‚Äçüíª. Hire me. You will not regret.",
